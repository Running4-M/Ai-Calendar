    <h1>Must Read Before Signing Up!</h1>

    <p><strong>Hi HN,</strong></p>
    <p>I’m excited to share a project I’ve been working on—a Personalized AI Calendar with ChatGPT Integration—and I’m looking for up to 20 people to test it out during a 7-day trial.</p>

    <h2>Important Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bookmark the Link:</strong> The website URL for this trial does not have a custom domain name, so you won’t be able to access it by searching online. Please bookmark the link or add it as a shortcut during the trial to ensure you can access the website easily for these seven days.</li>
        <li><strong>Discord Sign-Up Note:</strong> When you click on the Discord link to join the community, you must sign up immediately. If you don’t complete the sign-up and later try to click the link again, it will appear invalid. This is a Discord limitation where each invite link is single-use per individual.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What This AI Calendar Does</h2>
    <p>This tool is designed to help you plan and prepare for tasks ahead of time, not just jot down quick notes or reminders. It’s all about getting a head start on tasks that require creativity or preparation. Here’s how it works:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> Spend 10 minutes at the start of the week to create events for all the tasks you plan to work on. This lets the AI generate tailored responses on the scheduled day, saving you time and effort.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-Driven Responses:</strong> On the day of the event, the AI will deliver customized responses to kickstart your tasks, such as brainstorm ideas, outlines, or strategies for roadblocks.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Refinement:</strong> Use the "Start Chat" feature to adjust the AI’s responses to your specific needs for a personalized experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible Scheduling:</strong> Drag and drop events to adjust timing as needed. AI responses are generated only on the scheduled day to provide relevant support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Trial Details and How to Sign Up</h2>
    <ul>
         <li><strong>Commitment Required:</strong> Please only sign up if you’re willing to give it a proper try and provide feedback. 
             <ul>
            <li><br>I believe that seven days offer enough time for you to see how this calendar can help with your day-to-day life.</li> 
            <li><br>If for any reason you cannot commit to seven days, three days is also acceptable as a minimum. However, I would love for you to try the full seven days.</li>  
            <li><br>Regardless of the duration, please share your feedback with me throughout the trial or at the end—either through the provided Discord or email channels.</li> 
                 </ul>
         </li>
        <li><strong>Fake Emails Welcome:</strong> You can use a fake email to sign up. Just choose a simple password you’ll remember since there’s no password recovery feature.</li>
        <li><strong>Chat Limitations:</strong> During the trial, chat is limited to 10 messages per session and 100 words per user message.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Need help? A help page with step-by-step instructions and images is available on the website.</p>

    <h2>Why Only 20 Testers?</h2>
    <p>This trial is limited to 20 people so I can gather meaningful feedback and ensure a smooth experience. Feedback can include feature suggestions, UI improvements, or general thoughts on functionality and usability.</p>

    <h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mobile-Friendly:</strong> Use a desktop, laptop, or mobile device for the best experience during the trial.</li>
        <li><strong>Password Warning:</strong> You might see an alert from Google saying, “your password may be compromised.” This is a false positive with Firebase Authentication. Simply click "Ignore" to proceed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hope you Enjoy!</h2>
    <p>If you’ve ever struggled with staying productive or getting started on tasks, I’d love for you to try this out. This is a tool designed for <strong>planning ahead</strong> so that when the day comes, the AI response helps you dive into your task without wasting time.</p>
    <p>Let me know if this sounds interesting, and I look forward to your feedback. Thanks for reading!</p>
